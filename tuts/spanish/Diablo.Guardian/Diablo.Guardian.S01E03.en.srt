1
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,094
Eric.

2
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,134
Nobody’s rich in New York.

3
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,595
Not enough, you know?

4
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,515
There’s always something 
 you can’t have.

5
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,141
It’s hard to admit,

6
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,310
but I couldn’t stop 
 thinking of Superman.

7
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,605
I ordered the most expensive 
 dish in the menu.

8
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,982
Just to make up for it.

9
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,682
A hundred thousand dollars.

10
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,142
Fucking Yankee thief!

11
00:02:22,226 --> 00:02:24,979
It felt as if 
 the universe had conspired

12
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:26,605
to screw me over.

13
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,845
BASED ON
XAVIER VELASCO'S NOVEL

14
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,430
CHAPTER 3
NEW YORK: TRICK OR TREAT

15
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,517
Darling?

16
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,978
It’s me. Open up.

17
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,737
Open up, darling.

18
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,824
I want to talk with you.

19
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,370
I can’t, I’m busy.

20
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,499
You haven’t had breakfast yet.

21
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,795
Why don’t you come outside 
 and grab a bite so we can talk?

22
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,387
I’ve a lot of homework.

23
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,017
I understand 
 that you’re sad, but...

24
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,520
Everything will be fine, 
 I’ll get well.

25
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,481
I start the treatment today.

26
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,952
I’ll come out later, Mommy,
I promise.

27
00:04:05,955 --> 00:04:07,456
I can’t right now.

28
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,797
I can’t.

29
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,691
What did you do
with my bucks, asshole?

30
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,109
I spent it.

31
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:38,153
How did you spend
forty fucking thousand dollars?

32
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,533
I don’t want to live
in an apartment,

33
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,326
I live in the best hotel
in the world.

34
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:48,372
But I do.

35
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,835
I want my bucks.

36
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:54,420
I just want it.

37
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,578
I don’t want to save.

38
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,872
I trusted you.

39
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,800
Like a typical Yankee,

40
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:44,678
Eric wasn’t able 
 to go with the flow,

41
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,680
and foreseeing our poor future,

42
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:49,683
he thoughtfully rented 
 a stinky apartment.

43
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,353
Five floors, no lift.

44
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,151
Yeah, for you, asshole.

45
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,962
Even if he was happy,

46
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,006
I felt he had restricted 
 my freedom.

47
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:22,966
Who gave him that right, 
 you know?

48
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,087
New house, new life.

49
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,803
You’re nuts if you think
I’ll live here.

50
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:10,347
- What?
- It’s awful! Can’t you see?

51
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,103
Call the administrator,
I want my money back.

52
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,526
Why can’t anybody get it?
You’re just like my parents.

53
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,619
A happy ending.

54
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:40,145
Bye, bye, dreamed life.

55
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:42,189
Hello, rathole.

56
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,833
At least we’ve got a nice view.

57
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,173
But it is for me.

58
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,261
No need to convince me.

59
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,637
I’m here.

60
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,973
We will freeze during winter.

61
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,016
I’ll keep you warm.

62
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,559
I’ll take care of you.

63
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:20,894
I’ll protect you.

64
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,396
I hate you.

65
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,340
At first, everything was nice.

66
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,677
Taking showers, kissing, 
 laughing,

67
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,804
fucking all the time.

68
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,057
You know, 
 beginnings are always good.

69
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,427
Do you like it?

70
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:38,407
Long time no see.

71
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,576
- What happened?
- Can I come in?

72
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,286
Sure, come on in.

73
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:49,876
So?

74
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,962
What will you buy?

75
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,258
Don’t hold back, I’m loaded.

76
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,302
As long as I lose myself,
I don’t fucking care.

77
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,305
Look.

78
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,102
You’ll be really stoned
with these, man, they’re top-notch.

79
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,895
They’re national, you see?

80
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,773
- We’re fucking patriotic.
- Fuck yeah.

81
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,358
Can I take it here?

82
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,527
Sure! The booze is there
if you want some.

83
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,868
Damn it, man.
What are you doing?

84
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,203
I’ll pay for them,
Caiman, no problem.

85
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:26,872
No, that’s not it.
You already took one,

86
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,123
you can’t take more.

87
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:29,541
Why not? Who says so?

88
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,126
Because that thing
is really strong,

89
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,836
the trip lasts for hours.

90
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:35,046
It will last twice as much then.

91
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,300
You’ll be flying all night, man.

92
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:41,136
- Good.
- You’re really nuts.

93
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,305
Not yet.

94
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,354
Mommy?
Mommy?

95
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:59,274
Mommy?

96
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,944
Mommy.

97
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:06,948
Mommy, wake up, Mommy!

98
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,627
- Hello!
- Hi.

99
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,421
I did some shopping.

100
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:23,590
Hold on.

101
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:25,800
Hold on, okay?

102
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:35,852
It’s nice.

103
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,024
When the Yankee started 
 to do the math,

104
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,901
I could hear the stars falling.

105
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,778
One by one.

106
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:50,075
I deeply hate 
 middle-class arithmetic.

107
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,118
I can’t believe how everything 
 becomes a drag

108
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:53,328
in a few weeks.

109
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,163
You know me, “Diablo”.

110
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,248
What’s life without passion?

111
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,671
No matter how hard we tried, 
 we were infinitely different.

112
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,821
Superman was... 
 I don’t know...

113
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,156
decent, a nice person.

114
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,451
He had all the traits 
 I lacked.

115
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,286
I felt like yelling at him:

116
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,164
"I want to fuck Lex Luthor!"

117
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,875
I mean it, decent guys 
 aren’t my style.

118
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,256
Kissing,

119
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:48,800
the bed and sharing the shower 
 was a drag.

120
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:51,803
We were in survival mode.

121
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,556
And I hadn’t come 
 to New York to survive.

122
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,349
I wanted to live.

123
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,354
And at this pace, 
 I would end up hating it.

124
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:06,735
Eric!

125
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,319
Eric!

126
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:37,992
I know.

127
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,223
Do you hear me?

128
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,769
Yes. I’m sorry, doctor.

129
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,608
I know you’re having a hard time.

130
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:54,110
You’re her only close relative.

131
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:01,200
Sometimes the closeness
and the family support

132
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:04,996
are better than any treatment.

133
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,583
I’m sorry, doctor.

134
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:10,293
I just went out for a while,

135
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,420
I thought the maid was with her.

136
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,174
Try not to do it again.

137
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,932
Son of a bitch!

138
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,601
Give me my money, asshole!

139
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,311
Let me go!

140
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:11,771
Let me go already!

141
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,001
Did you get the bacon?

142
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:42,885
I forgot.

143
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,973
I don’t know,
whatever you order is fine.

144
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:51,936
Are you okay?

145
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,190
I’m tired.

146
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,401
I’ll take a shower.

147
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,753
Sorry,
I didn’t want to wake you.

148
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,588
What are you doing here?

149
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,257
Shouldn’t you be at school?

150
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,675
I finished early.

151
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,186
I can read you something
if you want.

152
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,148
Yes, something you wrote?

153
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,651
No. I meant from the novel.

154
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:43,237
Oh, that’s a shame!

155
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:49,577
I wanted you to read me something
from your blog.

156
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,957
I guess it must be really funny...

157
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,418
it must be good and fun.

158
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,631
You made me laugh a lot
when you were a kid.

159
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:07,345
You’re becoming a man.

160
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:13,059
Don’t worry,
keep doing your thing.

161
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,356
But read me something,
you choose.

162
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,207
Wanna go in?

163
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,602
I’m over here, Yankee.

164
00:23:58,146 --> 00:24:00,815
No, don’t get confused,
I’m much prettier.

165
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:11,242
Just as Violetta would think 
 Eric wouldn’t leave her,

166
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:14,328
Eric would think 
 that Violetta

167
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:16,330
could be happy eating bacon

168
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,708
instead of scamming others.

169
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,677
What did I want to prove?

170
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,304
That I was a good thief?

171
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,680
No.

172
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:35,474
Just that I was capable 
 of anything.

173
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:39,270
Only in the States 
 could you steal an identity.

174
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:30,571
Mommy.

175
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,242
Let’s see.

176
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:45,461
If your parents saw
everything you do,

177
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,381
they’d be very proud.

178
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,885
Don’t get used to it.

179
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,971
I’ll stop when you get better.

180
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,518
Go on, Mommy.
Eat up.

181
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,228
It’s toasted.

182
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:03,771
As we like it.

183
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,654
Yeah, really toasted.

184
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,425
What did they do to you?

185
00:26:54,655 --> 00:26:55,740
Listen, Eric,

186
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:58,826
I want to live my life
the way I want, I’m sorry.

187
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,668
I was wrong.

188
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:10,129
I thought I needed you,
but I don’t.

189
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:15,760
And you don’t need me either.

190
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,599
Eric.

191
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:15,945
I cried for being such a bitch 
 and such an ass.

192
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:19,156
I hate myself 
 for tearing everything apart.

193
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,367
But I’m also proud of it.

194
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,786
End of the story.

195
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:26,038
Superman didn’t rescue Violetta.

196
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,723
Mommy.

197
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,935
Wake up.

198
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:53,691
Mommy.

199
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,529
Are you hungry, darling?

200
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,950
Do you want some chocolate milk?

201
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,329
I'll be back.

202
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:28,804
Don’t be sad, sweety.

203
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,806
You must be strong
for your grandma.

204
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,143
Your parents are now in heaven
and they’re very happy.

205
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,316
Granny!

206
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:31,825
Here.

207
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:43,754
Shoot.

208
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,845
Javier!

209
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,806
What are you doing?

210
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,442
Look Pig, I’m sure there are 
 many options in your world

211
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:47,985
of private schools, 
 big houses

212
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:49,319
and full fridges.

213
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:50,946
But in the streets, 
 there is only one:

214
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,406
Resilience.

215
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:53,949
Either you have it or not.
