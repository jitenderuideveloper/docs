1
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:10,970
Sometimes I feel
you won’t believe a thing.

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,931
But the truth is,
I was very nervous.

3
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,184
I crossed the border
like any other poor devil.

4
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,401
I’m American.

5
00:00:26,152 --> 00:00:28,195
I’m American.
I’m American.

6
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:30,322
Remember it was
Violetta who crossed,

7
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:31,782
not Rosalba.

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,577
Violetta was bold
and willing

9
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,078
to have it her way.

10
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:38,956
Do you get it?
You always get me, Pig.

11
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,036
Come on, motherfuckers!

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,204
Get down!

13
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,664
Hurry up, assholes,
you’re now on the right side!

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,630
What’s in that suitcase?

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,966
Clothes.

16
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:34,053
You should really love
your clothes...

17
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,764
to show that much skin.

18
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,352
I can show you if you want.

19
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:45,898
All right!

20
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,433
BASED ON
XAVIER VELASCO'S NOVEL

21
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,560
CHAPTER 2
FASTER THAN SUPERMAN

22
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,445
My parents won’t know.

23
00:03:58,906 --> 00:03:59,990
You speak Spanish.

24
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,743
I’m Eric.

25
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:14,296
Okay, I’ll stay at your place,
but just for tonight.

26
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,887
I’m Violetta.

27
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:25,641
And I did run away from home.

28
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,435
If Eric hadn’t shown up,

29
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,354
I would have been deported
the next day.

30
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,983
I was on the right side
of the border,

31
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,901
but far away from New York.

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,695
I needed Eric.

33
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,990
Take note,
”Diablo Guardián”,

34
00:04:41,115 --> 00:04:42,574
here starts the chapter:

35
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:45,077
"Superman rescues Violetta".

36
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,444
- What’s up, 'Caiman'!
- I’m glad you came, dude!

37
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,071
How are you? Come in.

38
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,119
Want a cigarette?

39
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,372
Good for you.

40
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,669
Tobacco kills.

41
00:05:36,587 --> 00:05:38,338
- Where’s “Caimana”?
- Over there.

42
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:40,174
Let’s go.

43
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,301
She’s loaded today.

44
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,512
That way.
Be right back.

45
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:48,515
This way.

46
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,322
What’s up, Caimana!

47
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,201
How are you, Pig?

48
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:13,248
I’ve got your order.
Three squares.

49
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,626
They’re really good.

50
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:19,588
If you take another two,
it’ll be 40 dollars.

51
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,298
They’re top quality.

52
00:06:22,758 --> 00:06:23,926
All right!

53
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,929
Do you want fresh cannabis?

54
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,057
It just arrived.

55
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,684
- It’s top-notch.
- The best in the area.

56
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,186
No, thanks.

57
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,902
So, you don’t want
to go to New York?

58
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,916
But, do you want to be an actor?

59
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,468
Well, you don’t know yet.
You haven’t tried.

60
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,764
Sit down! Come!

61
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,477
Why don’t you come with me?

62
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,650
Well, but dreams come true.

63
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,030
What’s your dream?

64
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,452
To be rich.

65
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:40,794
- What are you doing?
- Imagine you’re in New York!

66
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,297
What would make you
the happiest man?

67
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,469
Perfect!
We’ll fly to Broadway tomorrow!

68
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,180
Are you crazy?

69
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:54,141
But I do.

70
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,355
Who cares...

71
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,211
For any other woman,

72
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:25,297
the first kiss tastes
like lust, romance,

73
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,007
like "I’m the happiest girl!"

74
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:30,510
For me, it was like
a stamp on the passport.

75
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,896
Could you describe

76
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,773
the exact turns
of a roller coaster?

77
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,608
No, me neither.

78
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,487
But before I knew, Superman
had taken me flying to New York.

79
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,304
Isn’t it the most wonderful place
you’ve ever seen?

80
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:17,766
You won’t think I’ll get

81
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,977
to the Royal Vanderbilt
looking like a hobo.

82
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,646
You should also change clothes
for your auditions.

83
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,775
Nothing, I’m just saying,
"dress for success".

84
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,819
And I want to be very successful.

85
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,034
My dad’s an asshole
that doesn’t even know where I am!

86
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,161
But does your mother know?

87
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:40,163
No, she believes I’m in Houston.

88
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,960
Expensive clothes
are like... I don’t know, a magnet.

89
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,629
Something that you want
and that makes you feel wanted.

90
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,007
- You’re crazy!
- No, I’m just happy.

91
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,638
Hey! Can we talk
in English all the time?

92
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,515
I want people to think I’m American.

93
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,686
Thanks for the sweet words.

94
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,604
- Sweet words?
- Yeah!

95
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,653
Money tickled me.

96
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,530
Hey! To the men’s department!

97
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,033
Eric was so nice,
he didn’t make any questions.

98
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,948
If Eric taught me
to make love,

99
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,075
I could teach him
tons of stuff

100
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:23,410
that are only possible

101
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,078
when you have
thousands of dollars.

102
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,998
I have 200 thousand dollars
in the suitcase.

103
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,295
For now,
one thing was certain...

104
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,340
I wouldn’t let Eric
deny me anything.

105
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,533
What’s up, dude!

106
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,244
You opened another blog, right?

107
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,828
You listened to me.

108
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,668
I’ve read it, it’s cool.

109
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,212
You’ve got attitude.

110
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,549
Wanna read what I’m working on?

111
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,467
Yeah, show me.

112
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,475
It’s cool, dude.

113
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,019
What a shitty country, man.

114
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:16,314
Hey! They call you "Sapo", right?

115
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,857
You know they do, dude.

116
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,277
What are you doing later, Sapo?

117
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,739
Nothing. The usual.
I mean, I’ll watch a movie.

118
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,867
Would you go with me on a trip?

119
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,244
Where to?

120
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:30,870
Come in.

121
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:34,791
Damn it, dude! This screen is huge!

122
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,211
- You can grab the girls' boobs...
- Don’t touch the screen, man.

123
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,838
- You’ll stain it.
- Oh, sorry.

124
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:43,258
Boys... I brought you some snacks...

125
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:44,676
- Hi.
- ...and something to drink.

126
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:48,430
- I don’t want you to starve.
- Thanks, that’s nice.

127
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,973
- Sure.
- Thanks, Mommy.

128
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,268
Look... we’ve got a ton of homework.
So, I’ll lock the door, okay?

129
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:55,937
All right. You don’t mind
if I listen to music

130
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,063
in the living room?

131
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,399
- No, no.
- Not at all.

132
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,943
Well, eat up or the snacks
will get cold

133
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,112
- and they’re perfect.
- Thanks a lot, ma’am.

134
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:05,405
Welcome.

135
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,914
She’s a very classy lady, right?

136
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,547
- Holy shit, man!
- Have you tried them?

137
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,884
No, but they say at school
they’re the shit.

138
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:27,636
Open your mouth.

139
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,139
Now? It’s only six o’clock!

140
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,642
Your grandma offered me snacks
and you, some acids.

141
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,063
This is the trip I promised you.

142
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,065
These are the tickets.

143
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,153
How long does the trip last?

144
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:46,905
About three hours.

145
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,032
You’ll have time
to watch your movie.

146
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:53,620
All right!

147
00:16:01,503 --> 00:16:03,004
We must wait a while.

148
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,512
Fucking Sapo!

149
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,149
Hello, the text is unread.

150
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,735
Could you upload it again?

151
00:18:34,739 --> 00:18:38,576
IMAGINARY CIRCLE

152
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:40,662
Shit!

153
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,456
Good morning, sir.

154
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,836
I brought you breakfast.

155
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:51,381
- Where’s my grandma?
- She left early to do some errands.

156
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:53,591
- By herself?
- Yes.

157
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:55,635
Excuse me, sir.

158
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,854
My Blog / Nieves Navarro
About me / Sex: Female

159
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:09,148
Age: 21 / Occupation: Student
Journalist / Mexico City

160
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,002
I swear my legs
were shaking like jelly.

161
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:15,089
And although jelly is tacky,
it couldn’t show now.

162
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,241
Quite different
from "Chilangolandia".

163
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:43,409
Chilang...?

164
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:45,995
My town.

165
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:48,289
Why don’t you act for me?

166
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,918
Yes, you must rehearse.

167
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,380
What are you doing?

168
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,273
I’m glad you’re here!

169
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,229
Did you know they change
the window display every Monday?

170
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,106
I won’t miss any.

171
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,861
But look what type of watch.

172
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,746
Yeah, and I’m gonna buy that watch.

173
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,377
I’m gonna be the most famous
actor’s girlfriend, right?

174
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,612
Are you Nieves?

175
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,741
- And are you Fabi...?
- Pig.

176
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,576
Pig, okay.

177
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:34,205
It’s weird.
I’d never seen you here before.

178
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,749
Frankly, there’s not much to do here.

179
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:39,627
I know, you read my blog.

180
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,547
Dude, it’s amazing!

181
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:45,299
I love that you hate
on unpatriotic people!

182
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,759
They ask for it.

183
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,262
Now, even piss-poor peasants
want to be American.

184
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,764
What’s up, dude? Shall we go?

185
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,476
Damn it, man.
Can’t you see I’m busy?

186
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,938
But you said we’d go
on a trip, didn’t you?

187
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,899
Go on a trip?

188
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,943
Do you have “candies”
in your backpack or what?

189
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,488
- Have you tried them?
- Yeah, dude.

190
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:09,532
With my brother
during vacation last year.

191
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,284
It was fucking awesome!

192
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,619
I’m thinking of selling them here
for twice its value.

193
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:15,288
No kidding, dude.

194
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,331
If they catch you,
they’ll kick you out.

195
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,709
I think it’s a great business.

196
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,045
You see, pussy!

197
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,707
Shake it off, Yankee!

198
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:05,171
Well, why don’t you ask
for another chance?

199
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,762
Well, you’ll get another casting.

200
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,565
You already are.

201
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,442
Can’t I have more?

202
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,237
God, Yankee!

203
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:14,073
I love to spend money with you.

204
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,076
I can be happy with you
even without it.

205
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:20,496
Being poor is tacky.

206
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,626
Promise me you’ll keep auditioning.

207
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:30,006
Parents!

208
00:26:30,131 --> 00:26:32,466
They won’t allow you to do
what they couldn’t.

209
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,225
It had never happened
with a girl before.

210
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:10,212
If you take them all,
it’ll be 80 dollars.

211
00:27:24,268 --> 00:27:26,645
How did it go, dude?
Did you sell them?

212
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,106
Shall we get more?

213
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,282
Dude...

214
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,284
do you like 'Holly'?

215
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,038
- What?
- Nieves, dude.

216
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,290
They call her
Holly Golightly at school.

217
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,583
I know, man!

218
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,337
- But you don’t know why.
- And you do?

219
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,758
Because she’s gone lightly
with everybody.

220
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:59,720
She’s horny as fuck.
Everybody’s had her.

221
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,222
That’s bullshit, man!

222
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,973
Holly isn’t a slut.

223
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:06,811
- What’s up, kids!
- Hey!

224
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:08,771
- How much?
- 112 dollars.

225
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:11,941
- Caiman, 112!
- I’m coming!

226
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,282
- What is that?
- 112 dollars.

227
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:21,700
All right!

228
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,000
Anything else?

229
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,461
- Make yourselves at home.
- Thanks.

230
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,754
Have fun.

231
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,383
Damn!

232
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,511
Shall we take them here?

233
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,447
You’re a genius.

234
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:07,580
What are you reading?

235
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:09,957
"The Catcher in the Rye".

236
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:13,377
My grandma gave it to me.
It’s cool.

237
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,297
What is it about?

238
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,008
A boy from New York

239
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,302
that runs away from high school.

240
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,762
And...

241
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:27,516
What?

242
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,770
What happened next?

243
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,026
Holy shit, dude!

244
00:29:37,651 --> 00:29:41,280
You should get into the school’s
storytelling contest.

245
00:29:41,989 --> 00:29:43,073
No.

246
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:45,576
I can’t create interesting characters.

247
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:53,125
So... write about someone you know.

248
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,816
Darling, use the cutlery.

249
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,075
How was your day?

250
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:28,577
Fine.

251
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,955
The usual.

252
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,625
Have you finished the book?

253
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,966
Try McCarthy,
you might like him!

254
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,685
- Darling?
- I’m sorry, Mom,

255
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:55,229
but I have to write this
on the computer.

256
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:56,772
Otherwise, I’ll forget.

257
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:14,039
Her name was Nieves
and she was perfect.

258
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,460
Listen, I want ten.

259
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:20,546
Yeah! Today.

260
00:31:21,422 --> 00:31:22,798
In two hours.

261
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:24,592
All right?

262
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:25,759
No.

263
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,220
Tomorrow’s better.
I’ll go, okay?

264
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:29,847
Yeah! About...

265
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,725
fifteen, okay?

266
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,900
Cool!
See you tomorrow.

267
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,949
Wanna hang out?

268
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,077
No, I’ll have supper at home.

269
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,887
Hi, Yankee boy.

270
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,145
What did your mom say?

271
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:25,152
And what will you do?

272
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,031
Don’t you get it?

273
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,127
Money only abandons the fucked up.

274
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,213
Do I look fucked up?

275
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,131
You aren’t looking for a job.

276
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,551
Well, if we run out of money,
I’ll get more! That’s it!

277
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,435
Listen carefully, Yankee.

278
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,980
It’s the first time I have money,
real money.

279
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,359
If you want to go back to Laredo,
that's your problem.

280
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:08,320
I’ll stay.

281
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,514
You’re a fucking pig!

282
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,491
Maybe I was doing
something terrible, but...

283
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,703
I felt if Eric got off the train,
Violetta could break down.

284
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,104
What’s up?

285
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:08,357
Did you forget or what?

286
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,027
Someone found a pill
in the restrooms

287
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,362
and took it to the principal.

288
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,364
Who?

289
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,157
I don’t want any trouble.

290
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:38,387
Who else knew about my business?

291
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:42,683
- What do you mean, fucker?
- The principal found out.

292
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:45,644
What? Holy shit!
They’ll kick you out?

293
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,020
He doesn’t know it was me...

294
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:48,856
yet.

295
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:51,567
What, dude?

296
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,652
Who was the fucker who rat on me?

297
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,738
Only Holly Golightly
knows about your business.

298
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,700
Quit it already, okay?
What’s up with her?

299
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:02,619
Dude, you tell her everything
and you don’t know her well.

300
00:36:02,703 --> 00:36:05,873
I know her better than you,
fucking butt-kisser.

301
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,875
You watch life from the sidelines.

302
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,960
You know what?
I don’t fucking care, dude.

303
00:36:10,043 --> 00:36:12,379
I’m sick of you.
If it wasn’t for me, you’d still be

304
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:13,881
the fucking outcast
you’ve always been.

305
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:15,632
I couldn’t care less!
I don’t need you.

306
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,385
So, stay away from me, asshole.

307
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,223
It was me.

308
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,393
What? Why?

309
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,604
I read what you wrote about me.

310
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,189
Did it bother you?

311
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,734
No! Not the fact
that you wrote about me.

312
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:36,194
It bothered me that you wrote
all those obscenities!

313
00:36:36,445 --> 00:36:38,030
We only kissed!

314
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,032
It’s the story for the contest.

315
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,075
I can write whatever
the fuck I want.

316
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,828
Well, at least
you could have made an effort to,

317
00:36:44,912 --> 00:36:46,747
I don’t know,
change my name, right?

318
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,582
I was going to, obviously.

319
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,209
I was following your advice.

320
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,337
I was writing about somebody I know.

321
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:55,213
But you don’t know me that well.

322
00:36:56,715 --> 00:37:00,093
- That’s why you made such a fuss?
- Indeed! I got mad,

323
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,304
I stole a pill from you,

324
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,348
took it to the principal,

325
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,016
and told him there was
a dealer at school.

326
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,268
I didn’t mention your name,
but you won’t be

327
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,020
messing around anymore.

328
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:14,107
You seem open-minded,
but you’re a prude like the others.

329
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:16,443
Of course I’m not a fucking prude!

330
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:20,113
Any girl would be grossed out
by a man saying those nasty things!

331
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:24,159
But you are indeed like the rest.

332
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,662
Why don’t you
keep writing on your blog

333
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:28,747
and stop making up fairy tales?

334
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,915
Pig!

335
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,482
Come here.

336
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:05,575
What’s up?

337
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,169
I have cancer.

338
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,391
So?

339
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,477
Are you going to die?

340
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,190
You too?

341
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:42,821
When?

342
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:47,117
Never.

343
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,620
Everything will be all right.

344
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,208
Calm down.

345
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,504
Calm down...

346
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:14,811
Calm down.

347
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:34,164
Congratulations!

348
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,267
Fuck you, I’m not interested!

349
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,021
I said I’m not interested!

350
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,613
No! Please, no!

351
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,702
Are you okay?

352
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,334
Going down to that basement
was pretty naive.

353
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:05,130
But I did learn something.

354
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:07,090
A woman with assets
in the right place...

355
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,179
...has complete power
to rule the world...

356
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:19,227
No, no, I just wanted to help you.

357
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:22,189
Where are you going?

358
00:41:24,232 --> 00:41:26,026
What? No!

359
