00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,477

00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,020

00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,036

00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,579


15
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,456
I give you a gift.

16
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:11,632
YEARS BEFORE ...

17
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,267
Almost ready!

18
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:23,185
Any day, you will
to kill us from pneumonia.

19
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:24,562
Oh, do not be exaggerated!

20
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,106
Do you know that ink has to
be rinsed with cold water.

21
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:30,359
We, the Rosa Valdivia,
we had the luck

22
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,443
of being born in D.F.,

23
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,195
but good luck
to look like gringos.

24
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:36,448
Seriously, you think
we look like gringos

25
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,908
with that fake tincture?

26
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,662
How do you want
that I begin?

27
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,999
Once upon a time there were two sheep
married mesti as

28
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,458
and had a little lamb

29
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:49,169
that was born black
like the bitch who gave birth to him! "

30
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,214
Your turn, bitchy girl.

31
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:53,716
Ave Maria Pur ssima,

32
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,885
I confess to being me
everywhere.

33
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,638
that is,
of wanting to be another.

34
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:04,018
Oh, Carmen,
thank you.

35
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:06,312
The Red Cross should
give you a place of honor

36
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:08,147
for all your donations.

37
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,232
Who should you be?
received with honor to the mr.

38
00:03:10,316 --> 00:03:12,234
You're making a
awesome work

39
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,569
with the helpless.

40
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,946
We, the ones we have the most,
we are the ones who should give the most.

41
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,448
When's the next dinner?

42
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,324
Ah, in a fortnight.

43
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,617
But do not worry,
I'll let you know.

44
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,951
Good evening, Carmen.

45
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,497
Violet,
nothing to tell them

46
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,124
stories of fear
before bedtime.

47
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,834
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

48
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,461
And they know why you
They have to be erased early.

49
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,629
the bedroom lights?

50
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,839
So that no
withdraw the subsidy.

51
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,341
That's right, genius!

52
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,384
Violetta, anything,
call us

53
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,303
Goodnight My Loves.

54
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,055
Because
Do you call her Violetta?

55
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,640
I always wanted to
her name is Violetta.

56
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,849
Your family
it was the one who insisted

57
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,309
in calling it Rosalba.

58
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,313
Listen, you know.
what animal is washed

59
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,773
with hosepipes
cold water

60
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,816
Pigs.

61
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,194
And we are not
pigs for bathing

62
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,528
with cold water, or are we?

63
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,744
Who wants to play
Beauty salon?

64
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:51,875
We buy
mattresses, refrigerators ...

65
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,680
Dear...

66
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,682
...come here.

67
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,491
- Stupid! Stupid!
- There! There!

68
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,909
- You naughty girl!
- Give it!

69
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,870
Give me more in you what you
do with this family

70
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:29,580
with your crazy plans!

71
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:33,083
- Crazy and dumb girl!
- What's going on?

72
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,877
Your daughter does not know
What to be ashamed of?

73
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,003
Nor will you ever know!

74
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,546
What did she do now?

75
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,257
Yesterday, I bathed in
brothers with hot water.

76
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,301
And it was not just that, I ended up with
your imported conditioner.

77
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,387
Open!

78
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,223
I can not stand her anymore!
I do not mind her!

79
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:50,017
What did these
nuns taught you?

80
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,685
You will see
how do you change your attitude

81
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,228
when to start school
for secretaries.

82
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,064
No, no, no.
I refuse to pay

83
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,357
the studies of this year,
ungrateful

84
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,318
And what if she
end up being assistant

85
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,903
from the president
of a multinational!

86
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:03,238
"Maybe I'll get you a husband."
- Yes, very good.

87
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,116
The only way
it is useful.

88
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:14,708
The only way
of becoming

89
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,710
Something useful, said the "deer."

90
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:24,093
The only way
I was going to New York.

91
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,442
In my head,
New York, it was the opposite

92
00:06:40,526 --> 00:06:42,236
to be in my house
as it springs.

93
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:45,072
Since I was a kid, I had
obsession for New York.

94
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,282
I cut and paste photos
in my wardrobe.

95
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:50,244
I imagined walking the streets
with my hair nig rrimo.

96
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,372
And laughed at the thought
in my father

97
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,707
Selling me a hot dog
and stealing my change.

98
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:18,897
YEARS BEFORE ...

99
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,791
I brought you a sandwich.
Make a space for me.

100
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,630
Mommy, how old?
Do you think I have it?

101
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:45,841
What's up? How many you have!

102
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,385
For me, you always
will be my spoiled boy.

103
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:53,432
Oh, I do not understand
What you do so much here.

104
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,475
So much time stuck
on this computer.

105
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:57,436
I told you, I have a blog.

106
00:07:57,728 --> 00:08:00,105
Well. Eat it,
because otherwise, it cools.

107
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,482
This is  torradinho ,
as we like.

108
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,049
Young lady

109
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,051
...wake up!

110
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,720
Do you know what day today?

111
00:08:32,304 --> 00:08:34,139
The worst day of my life?

112
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:37,392
Late afternoon.
And I have to go to the bank today.

113
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:38,894
to deposit the donations
of the Red Cross.

114
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,978
Do you want to get fired?

115
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:40,979
Come on, get up!

116
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,439
- There!
- ... and dress!

117
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,279
Are you going to do anything today?

118
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:32,030
Good morning ladies.

119
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,702
And who's this?

120
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,829
I do not know, but the dye
it was not enough

121
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,580
for these eyebrows
of taturana.

122
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:43,333
Today we have
a new companion.

123
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,627
Rosalba,
Do you want to introduce yourself?

124
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,757
Hi everybody,
I'm 18,

125
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,259
and I'm here
because my dream

126
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,844
become a secretary.

127
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:56,888
My name is Rosalba, but I prefer
Call me Violetta.

128
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,351
Violetta is the name
world.

129
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,603
No,
Rosalba is even more kitschy.

130
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:05,272
Even.

131
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:28,587
How was it?

132
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,132
"Shit," this school.

133
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,011
This little mouth.
Wash dishes.

134
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,007
Good afternoon Miss,
How are you?

135
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,218
- Normal.
- How nice.

136
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,220
Here's what I owed you.
from last week.

137
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,888
- Thank you very much.
- And that's the plant ...

138
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,515
Mom, I'm going
pick up the tea towel.

139
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:23,517
It's fine. And when
you finish the kitchen,

140
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,060
Carry on with
the dining room, you?

141
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,139
And what's yours? Since when
can you peek out the window?

142
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,434
I swear that it was
the first time.

143
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,394
Yeah, you seemed
an expert.

144
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,313
I swear.

145
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,107
There it is.

146
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:14,401
I do not care
May you see me.

147
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,574
I'll propose a deal.

148
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,243
I want you to steal from
his father the 500 pesos

149
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,661
that my mother is done
to give it to him.

150
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:28,498
If my father finds out
that I am

151
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,083
Taking money, it kills me.

152
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,793
Why do this?
without him discovering you.

153
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,717
Do you like to see me?

154
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,137
Would you like to see more?

155
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:44,431
A lot more?

156
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,561
With one condition.

157
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,189
I do not want 500 pesos ...

158
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,899
I want the same note
that my mother

159
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,275
gave to his father.

160
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,360
In fact, I made a
"V" in the corner.

161
00:12:57,736 --> 00:12:59,488
If it is not the same note,
has no agreement.

162
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,323
And if there is no agreement,

163
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,408
I'll see myself at the
shameful need

164
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,494
to tell my mother
That you're a pig.

165
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,878
The assassination of Archduke
Francisco Fernando,

166
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,005
heir to
Austro-Hungarian crown,

167
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,509
and his wife,
the archduchess Sofia,

168
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,677
triggered hostilities.

169
00:13:22,928 --> 00:13:24,513
Very important
let the names know

170
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,597
two countries

171
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,390
who participated
on the fronts.

172
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,227
I think what
you are writing,

173
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,103
Much more important

174
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,772
than anything
that I can say

175
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,398
about
the First World War.

176
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,610
Why not?
share with everyone?

177
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,991
No, thank you.

178
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,787
Sorry, but it was not
a proposal.

179
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,455
Start with the title.

180
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,005
We will not continue
while you speak

181
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,972
"Reasons I'm better
than the rest of the world. "

182
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,229
"Reason one.

183
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:18,024
"At the end, I feel that time
swallows me slowly

184
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,068
"inside
of his bowels. "

185
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:22,487
Wow, now the pig
became a poet!

186
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,698
Silence!

187
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,534
Continues.

188
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,412
"I open a door,

189
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,706
"and there are my parents.

190
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,668
"The two dead

191
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,878
"And at the same time, alive,

192
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,214
surprised
for my visit.

193
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,467
"I tell them that
I'm passing through.

194
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,554
"That in five minutes
I have to go

195
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,180
"back to reality ...

"End of reason one."

200
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,613
I think the hamburger
yesterday made me sick.

201
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,032
That's weird.
You did not hurt anyone else!

202
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,283
You're not hot.

203
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,577
I can not go to school.

204
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,080
What do you want? That I
vomit in front of everyone?

205
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,707
What a joke!

206
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,213
It's fine. Stay.

207
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:24,007
I'm going to the aerobics.

208
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,967
When you feel
a little better,

209
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,510
fold the clothes
that I left in bed.

210
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:59,042
Now yes,
gardener baby son of the m e.

211
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,627
You'll see just what's good!

212
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,328
That day was the
my great debut

213
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,331
And you know what I discovered?

214
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:24,127
To be desired
It's a heavy drug.

215
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,212
You plate

216
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,106
Which school
for secretaries!

217
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,650
Music taught me
to speak English

218
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,447
I would like to score
a time with ...

219
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,658
Mr Waltz.

220
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:41,746
I would like to score
a time with Mr. Waltz.

221
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,125
I would like to score
a time with Mr. Waltz.

222
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,019
Rosalba ...

223
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,481
... can you tell us what the
your plans for summer?

224
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,024
Discolor the "pussy".

225
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,027
You know what I
I will do this summer?

226
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:14,821
I'm going to be a millionaire.

227
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:17,031
By the way, my name is Violetta.

228
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,783
Very well.

229
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,500
I saw you, Pig!

230
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,796
If you go and make gossip,
I swear I'll kill you.

231
00:20:14,255 --> 00:20:16,841
Calm  vei ,
I'm by your side.

232
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,844
And what do you want in return?

233
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,514
Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm yours.
side, I already told you.

234
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,935
That day, man,
I did not know

235
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,895
about your parents
and all that

236
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,564
I liked very much
of what you read, you know?

237
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:32,899
Yeah, I do not.

238
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,944
Take it, you did not see anything.

239
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,030
Old man, if you do not like it
of what he writes,

240
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,698
open a blog
more funny or something.

241
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,075
Let's see if he's okay.

242
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,743
I'll go right away
call a physician.

243
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,915
- Hey, give it to me, my!
- Yes, Mr. Carraldi.

244
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,834
I have deposited the 50,000 pesos.

245
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,335
In a little while I'll tell you
or proof.

246
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,337
- Give it to me, give me! Oh my!
- Good afternoon to you.

247
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,131
Let's see, be quiet!

248
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,091
- Oh, Mommy! Mommy!
- There!

249
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,385
Oh my God! Carmem!

250
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:47,724
You just bit him, man.

251
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,809
And now, yes,
we arrived at the beginning

252
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:51,144
of true history.

253
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,064
It turns out that everyone
the weights my mother

254
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,899
collected at dinner
of the Red Cross,

255
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,818
the mother daughter's thief
deposited

256
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,194
a part in the bank,

257
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:02,613
and the other, she changed
for dollars for her.

258
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:05,783
Here, pay attention,
Devil, why did he start?

259
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,452
the history of how
I became a rich girl,

260
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,412
and I started to be ... me.

261
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,005
Knowing
What did my mother do?

262
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,339
a little tart bills
for the Red Cross,

263
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,591
it seemed very convenient

264
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:22,925
promote the gardener,
with a robbery

265
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:23,968
that it was worth more.

266
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:29,098
Do not run.

267
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,623
You know when suddenly
you jump a wall

268
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,750
and even knowing that it is
very high, you think:

269
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,295
"No one I know of
It jumped so high. "

270
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,262
Let's see, can you stay calm?
I brought you here

271
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,764
because I have
a mission for you.

272
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,601
I can not do
Nothing with my arm.

273
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:15,478
This you go
to be able to do, yes.

274
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,563
Throw something
from my mother's purse.

275
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,861
But you take it when I
I ask you, okay?

276
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,864
What happened
with our agreement, eh?

277
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,117
I just do
extra work.

278
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,993
Well, the devil
with the agreement.

279
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,411
I torro yours.
quick money

280
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,871
It's no good to me.

281
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,749
There's no way. If your mother
catch me, she kill me.

282
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,461
You want everybody
know it

283
00:23:40,545 --> 00:23:41,838
How did you break your arm?

284
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,633
Good.

285
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:48,553
I promise you it will be easy.

286
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,270
The little gardener
was my first accomplice.

287
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,189
But do not be shy.

288
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,692
Or, stay, if you want.

289
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:41,147
I did not count
with divine intervention

290
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:43,024
who filled with guilt or idiot.

291
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,234
The church bells?

292
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,988
The church bells!

293
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,990
God do not give you so much fear
when you get me

294
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,159
spying, and that yes,
that   mortal sin.

295
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:55,995
Forgive me.

296
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,622
I do not forgive you.
Give me the keys.

297
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:58,956
Give me

298
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:02,126
Your mother had a lot of
money in the purse?

299
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,544
What's up? Smelly!

300
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,130
I do not understand

301
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,132
Why do you want so much money?

302
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,967
There's your house, there's your school.

303
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,594
You do not lack anything.

304
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,970
I do not need anything

305
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:16,557
I need to be the
that I want to be.

306
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,228
You ... because you're one
slave who likes to own.

307
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:22,438
I ... I am my own mistress.

308
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,524
What? Do you really think?
that I conform

309
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,526
to go to school
of coarse secretaries?

310
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,237
Or being like my parents,

311
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,530
half-bowl thieves
Who are the charity?

312
00:25:32,657 --> 00:25:34,784
I'm full of being a maid,

313
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,119
of not having a penny,
of not being able to take a shower

314
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,621
with a water
at least lukewarm.

315
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,458
What? Do you really think?
that I own

316
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,252
I can not give myself a life
less frightening?

317
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,046
Oh, get out!

318
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,382
Come on, get out! No
I want to see you again!

319
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,133
What the hell is that, Rosalba?

320
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:57,765
Dad, I do not want to go back.
to see this guy.

321
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,518
He was spying on me.
through the window.

322
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,647
"How dare you!"
- In my own house!

323
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,816
"How dare you!"
"Why did you do that?"

324
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,609
- You were spying!
- Damn it!

325
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,388
Violet?

326
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,100
- Violet?
- Yes, Mom.

327
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,948
Your father has already told me
which the shameless did.

328
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,580
I do not want to talk
about it, Mom.

329
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,633
Do not think I'm stupid.

330
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,887
Men only look
when they have something to look at.

331
00:27:21,891 --> 00:27:23,100
Set the table.

332
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:27,772
Your brothers are hungry.

333
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,988
A , for a!

334
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:42,453
Here.

335
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,002
What's up?
Where did you get that?

336
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:52,088
A friend lent me.

337
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:54,757
They lent you this?

338
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,092
Was.

339
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:59,178
Yeah, idiot of
who lent you.

340
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,889
And idiot is still
you return.

341
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,643
Tell them they stole you.

342
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,937
What a good idea!

343
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,775
There! And now,
What happened to you?

344
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:16,404
Excuse me.
Can I get the broom?

345
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,308
To their disgrace,
me and them,

346
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,144
we had to
same logic.

347
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:50,813
And for my luck,
their security system

348
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,398
was very friendly.

349
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,495
I set everything up
so that no one noticed

350
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,706
the change of residence
of the money.

351
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:10,791
And I went down to clean, like
if nothing had happened.

352
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,796
Now that she was a rich girl,
I used to tend

353
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:16,964
how they were fucked!

354
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:18,466
I saw them and said:

355
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,926
What the fuck are they laughing at?

356
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,304
Because I had already left
they are very poor.

357
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:34,273
The tragedy
of "motherfuckers",

358
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,358
That your children do well
more "motherfuckers" than them.

359
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,363
You're going to say I do not do it.

360
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:43,491
But I do not care now.
What do you think?

361
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,952
Imagine me happy,
surrounded by notes,

362
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:48,537
and point.

363
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:01,050
Tell me the truth,
Did you start the fire?

364
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,514
- It was not me.
- You swear?

365
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,809
Okay, it was me, yeah.

366
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:15,523
What's up?
You heard the director.

367
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,982
They have no evidence.

368
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,151
Therefore they can not
do anything with me

369
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:23,113
They are lost,
because they are losers.

370
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:24,865
But because you
Do these things?

371
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,284
He forced me to read my blog
in front of the whole room.

372
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,827
He teased.

373
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:32,665
"What did you read?"
- Nothing, you would not understand.

374
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:37,002
- Why?
- Because you do not understand.

375
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,338
Because she's old.

376
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,007
Ah, you're ashamed to
May your mother be an old woman?

377
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,760
You're not my mother.
My mother is dead.

378
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:48,514
Shame on me for being a son.

00:32:33,827 --> 00:32:35,496
Open that door!

381
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,122

Open that door!
We have to talk.

383
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:50,177
What did you do?

384
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,431
What did you do with
Your beautiful blond hair?

385
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,850
First, it takes bombs
in school and now this!

386
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,644
Let's see, you are like this.
Why did I pump?

387
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,521
And you think little?

388
00:33:04,108 --> 00:33:07,277
You're not going to walk like this.
with that hair of a prostitute.

389
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,572
You're our calvary.

What we did for

391
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,495
You are pretentious,
"wannabes" shit!

392
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:20,749
- Rosalba!
My name is Violetta!

393
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:25,129
- You do not have a drug!

394
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,468
Rosalba!
Open that door!

395
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,596
Rosalba!
Open that door!

396
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,181
Where are you going?

397
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,643
- Where do you think you're going?
- You cocks!

398
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:54,366
What an idiot!

399
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,577
That's what makes me angry and
to leave like this, without further ado.

400
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,912
Now I had to go back
l  to get my money.

401
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,039
Because it was
My money, you know?

402
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,417
Shit! Shit!

403
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:05,919
Shit!

Shit! Shit!

405
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,678
Oh, Devil ...

406
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:15,846
It's better when you write this,

407
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:18,182
do not put me in the car
so alone and crying.

408
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,517
Make up something better.

No it's allowed

...I'm so sorry.

415
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,834
OK.

416
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,716
We accept your
Sorry, little girl.

417
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,976
But it's not that easy.

418
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,895
You already know what
Your father and I thought.

for boarding school, that's fine.

421
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,443
It's going to have to be this way!

422
00:36:23,724 --> 00:36:24,725
Dad...

423
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:26,685
Can we stop at the church?

424
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,353
That I want

425
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:46,955
- Ave Maria Pur ssima.
- Sin conceived.

426
00:36:47,289 --> 00:36:48,582
Speak, child.

427
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:52,085
I do not even know where
begin, father.

428
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:54,630
For what most afflicts you, daughter.

429
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,217
Good...

430
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,763
I stole thousands
of my parents' dollars.

431
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,934
Thousands of dollars, daughter?

432
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:12,564
Two hundred seventeen thousand.

433
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,276
They were
stored in the closet.

00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,489
Of all charges

00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,740

I think love

00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:27,996
Come to me from family.

438
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,419
Do you believe in this
history of 100 years

439
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,171
of forgiveness for those who
steals a thief?

440
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,007
It's true
What are you telling me, daughter?

441
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,010
This money can not be
in the hands of sinners.

442
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,972
If you want God to forgive you,

443
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:47,307
You have to hand over the money.

444
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,559
Which of them, Father?

445
00:37:50,978 --> 00:37:55,148
Bring the money here to
the church and we will share it.

446
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,610
Of course, son of a bitch!

447

I come tomorrow

448
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,674
Allow me
Five minutes, please?

449
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:22,300
Sure, Father.

I told you that I thought
tell you the whole truth.

451
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,867
But, as you would say:

452
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,036
"Who am I,
to know who I am? "
